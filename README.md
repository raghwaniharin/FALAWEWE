Manish has approached us to create mockups and wireframes of this company’s website then we need to discuss any changes then create a functioning website. This document provides a record of the events and what we have discussed in the meetings.
The document also shows different versions of the mockups outlining how the website has improved in the designing stages.

VISUAL DETAILS
We have been instructed to make wireframes and mockups of 4 pages- Home, Shop, Contact and about us pages. The home page shall be a simplistic welcome page with the company logo and slogan.
The shopping page of the website will contain some simplistic pictures showcasing the unique clothing and apparel that our client wishes to sell. We shall also use different font sizes such that we can convey the more important information easier than with a singular font size. We also included a navigation bar which enhances user engagement and helps in easier maneuvering between pages that can help the users hop at our store quicker.
We also implement different font sizes so that we can draw the eyes of the user according to what’s more important.
